# CryptoTrade Machine Learning Simulation #

- Developed a simulation of a trading bot system using Random Forest and Deep Neural Network algorithms to customize strategy portfolios based on investors’ risk endurance. The performance comparison of the general market baseline strategies-Buy & Hold and SMA are well applied in both the investment return (ROI) and risk loss control (Sortino ratio) perspectives during the same periods’ hourly and daily data from spot and future markets.
-  Data Source: Spot or Futures daily data from Yahoo Finance, hourly data from Binance Data Periods: 2022 July 4th -2023 Feb 28th
-  Complete a research paper that examines the implementation of machine learning methodologies to manage risk in bot trading with the spot market and the innovative futures market. According to the result of our strategies for risk management, it may easily conclude that our research provides a practical approach to ensuring the safety of the trader investment in this highly unpredictable market.
